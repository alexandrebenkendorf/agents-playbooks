**Description:** Core coding practices that ensure code quality, maintainability, and team consistency across the codebase.

## 3. TypeScript Best Practices (typescript)

**Impact:** HIGH  
**Description:** Proper TypeScript usage prevents runtime errors, improves IDE support, and enables better refactoring capabilities.

## 4. Clean Code Principles (clean)

**Impact:** HIGH  
**Description:** Clean Code principles create maintainable, readable code that is easier to understand, test, and modify.

## 5. SOLID Principles (solid)

**Impact:** HIGH  
**Description:** SOLID principles create flexible, maintainable architectures that are easier to extend and test.

## 6. Clean Architecture (architecture)

**Impact:** HIGH  
**Description:** Clean Architecture separates concerns, making code more testable, maintainable, and independent of frameworks.

## 7. Performance Optimization (performance)

**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Description:** JavaScript/DOM performance patterns that reduce execution time and improve user experience.

## 8. Helper Functions (helper)

**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM  
**Description:** Common utility patterns for data transformation, validation, and formatting that improve code reusability.
