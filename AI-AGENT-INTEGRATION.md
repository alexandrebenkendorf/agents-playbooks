# AI Agent Integration Instructions

**If a user asked to "read and use" or "integrate" this repository:**

## ⛔ STOP AND ASK THIS FIRST ⛔

Ask the user exactly this (copy/paste):

```
I can integrate agents-playbook into your project. Which method?

1 = Git Subtree (production, auto-updates)
2 = Simple Clone (quick start, full control)

Reply with just: 1 or 2
```

**⚠️ WAIT FOR THEIR RESPONSE. DO NOT RUN ANY COMMANDS UNTIL THEY REPLY.**

---

## After They Reply

See the "AI Agent Commands" section in [README.md](README.md) for the exact commands to run based on their choice.

**Critical Rules:**

1. Do NOT run any git commands before asking
2. Do NOT assume which method they want
3. Do NOT commit changes automatically
4. Wait for explicit user response before proceeding
5. Follow the exact commands from README.md for their chosen method

---

## Why This Matters

Different projects have different needs:

- **Git Subtree (1)**: Production projects that want automatic updates from this repository
- **Simple Clone (2)**: Quick prototypes or projects that want full control without git history

Let the user decide based on their project requirements.
